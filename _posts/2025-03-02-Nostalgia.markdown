![Nostalgia from inside out](../assets/nostalgia.jpg)


Of all the emotions or feelings, my favourite is nostalgia. The childhood that was filled with trauma, fear, and loneliness, the teenage years that were filled with uncertainty and regrets, and then the fast-paced life with all the previous problems being persistent, nostalgia seems to smoothen the noise and fit the curve perfectly for the bright and shiny days. The heartbreak that shook my world is a loving memory that makes me feel that I was once loved and I'm capable of loving someone. The trauma-filled childhood is the most peaceful part of my life; the uncertainty and poverty in the teens are where I was working on myself. This could be an evolutionary trait; my brain is trying to reduce the pain, which makes it even more beautiful. This emotion can be easily judged as delusional. In this world filled with reality checks, nostalgia seems like a shield we developed over billions of years to occasionally get comfortable. Don't get me wrong; I'm not overlooking the fact, the number of times the same Nostalgic Nana made me cry with her coldness, unexpectedly bringing up something I so badly wanted to forget, a regret, a shame, a haunting devil I cast a powerful spell of forgetfulness on and caged in the necklace and threw deep in the ocean. She swam through the depths, brought it back, and opened it, but if it weren't for her efforts, I wouldn't have embraced those traits, that past, which was equally a part of me. In retrospect, even that was to heal me. So, Nostalgia, thanks for teaching me that in this slurry of entropy is hidden order, and you'll always be there to find it.
